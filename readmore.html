    <h2>How Ice Cream is Made</h2>
    <p>
        The basic ingredients for ice cream include milk, cream, sugar, and flavorings. The mixture is heated to kill bacteria and then cooled before being churned in an ice cream maker. Churning incorporates air and prevents the formation of large ice crystals. Additional ingredients like chocolate chips, nuts, and fruits can be added during the final stages of churning. The finished product is then frozen at a very low temperature for a creamy texture.
